# Timer with Display

This Arduino script creates a countdown timer with a digital display. It includes routines to display numbers from 0 to 9 on a 7-segment display. When a button is pressed, the countdown starts from 9 and displays each number sequentially until reaching 0. During the countdown, a buzzer emits a sound signal, and an LED blinks.

## Installation

1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the `timer-con-display.ino` script to your Arduino board.
3. Make sure to include the necessary libraries:
   - LiquidCrystal (for controlling the display)
   - Keypad (for detecting button presses)

## Usage

1. Press the button connected to pin 11 to start the countdown.
2. During the countdown, the display will show numbers from 9 to 0 sequentially.
3. The buzzer will emit a sound signal, and the LED will blink during the countdown.
